## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Things I'm doing or have done:

* reading and writing software, for [Internet Archive Scholar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive_Scholar) and [digital preservation systems](https://support.archive-it.org/hc/en-us/articles/7581641831956-Vault), [Leipzig University Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig_University_Library) and others, mostly data engineering related, most of which is [open source](https://github.com/miku)
* reading and writing [books](https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL7497124A/Martin_Czygan) and [papers](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=7gueY4EAAAAJ)
* organizing [meetups](https://golangleipzig.space)
* assembling findings into [talks and workshops](https://github.com/miku/workshops)
* hopefully answering someone's question 35,000,000+ times on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/89391/miku?tab=profile)

I live on the [terminal](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs81n/command.txt).
